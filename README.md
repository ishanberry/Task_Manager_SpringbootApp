# Task_Manager_SpringbootApp
Hey everybody this is my first spring boot application which is a task manager app based on "CRUD " Operation on backend
as a tech stack, I have used frontend or view layer as Thymeleaf for generating dynamic content and the backend as Spring boot 
and as a database as Mysql  

API TEST POINT IS --
1- GET TASK -->  /TASKS
2- GET TASK BY ID --> /TASK/{taskid} 
3- UPDATE TASK --- > /TASK/UPDATE/{taskid}
4 -DELETE Task --->  /TASK/DELETE/{taskid}
